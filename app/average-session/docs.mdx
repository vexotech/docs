# Average session

### How it works

A session is defined from the moment a user opens the app until one of these:
- Closes the app
- Starts browsing other apps
- Locks the screen

The average session time is equal to the sum of the time of all the sessions divided by the number of sessions in a given time range:

*average session time = total session time / total sessions*

Understanding how long your user sessions are will serve you as a good starting point for identifying issues in the user journey.
This doesn't mean that low average sessions are because you have lower engagement!

For example, if your app scans and shares documents, the average session time will be probably low.
However, if the average session time is high could mean that users are taking too long to scan a document and it might be because the steps are not clear enough.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="average-session"
    previous={{ href: 'active-users', label: 'Active Users'}}
    next={{ href: 'unique-downloads', label: 'Unique Downloads' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
