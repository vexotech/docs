# Introduction

Vexo is the **first product analytics platform built specifically for React Native apps**, designed to work out-of-the-box with zero-configuration, zero-coding support.

Our focus has always been to make analytics seamless and powerful, so you can move faster without complex configurations.

Capture the data → transform it into actionable insights → present them on a UI that everyone on your team understands.

While **React Native** remains at the heart of Vexo, the same philosophy now extends to the **Web**. 

This means you can rely on Vexo across platforms, from mobile apps to browsers, with the same simplicity and clarity.

With Vexo you get:

- **Simplest integration in the market.**
- **Out-of-the-box dashboards instantly.**
- **Powerful cross-platform features.**
- **Mobile-first reliability.** React Native and Expo-optimized with full offline support.
- **Privacy built-in.** We don’t sell data. Opt-in/out, anonymization, and compliance-friendly defaults.
