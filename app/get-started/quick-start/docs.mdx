# Quickstart

## React Native

**Prerequisites**

- Using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) or [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/)

**Expo**

- ✅ You can use this library with [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/development/introduction/). No config plugin is required.
- This library can't be used in the "Expo Go" app because it [requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/).

**Getting started**

1. Create an account [here](https://www.vexo.co/sign-up)
2. You'll be prompted into creating a new app, give it a name (you can change it later), this will generate your API key.
3. Run **`yarn add vexo-analytics`** or **`npm install vexo-analytics`** in your project. If you are using bare React Native, run **`pod install`** in the iOS folder.
4. Add the following code to your app entry file (usually **`index.js`**, **`App.js`** or **`_layout.tsx`** if you're using Expo Router):

```javascript
import { vexo } from 'vexo-analytics';

// You may want to wrap this with `if (!__DEV__) { ... }` to only run Vexo in production.
vexo('YOUR_API_KEY');

```

1. Re-build and run your app (the **`vexo-analytics`** package includes native code).
2. Go to your app's page on Vexo and your first events should appear! 🎉

**Wait, that's it?** Yes! That's it. With that ease of integration experience you get an incredible set of features, go check them out!

## Web

**Getting started**

1. Create a Vexo account [here](https://www.vexo.co/sign-up) (skip if you already have one).
2. **Create a Web App.**
- On your dashboard click on **+ Add Application** create a new app.
- Enter a name (e.g. your website)
- Add the domain of your website (e.g., *example.com*)

1. **Add the Vexo Script**

To start collecting Web analytics data, paste the following script into your site’s **`<head>`** tag:

```html
<script src="https://www.vexo.co/analytics.js" defer></script>
```

1. **Track custom events and identify devices (optional)**

You can enhance your analytics by tracking custom events and identifying devices:

- Custom Event

```js
global?.vexo?.customEvent('purchased-completed', { amount: 24.99 });
```

- Identify device

```js
global?.vexo?.identifyDevice('user@example.com');
```

That’s it! Once the script is live on your site, Vexo will start capturing user sessions, session replays, custom events, and more — just like it does on mobile.
