# React Native Introduction

**Vexo** is the first *React Native‑focused* analytics platform. Providing a solution for precise and actionable data with a seamless integration and zero-configuration, zero-coding support.

Vexo combines **automatic analytics**, **session replays**, **screen & tap heatmaps**, **funnels**, and a **powerful People view,** all out-of-the-box.

- **Simple setup.** Vexo listens to React Native app events and navigation so usage is tracked automatically.
- **Numbers and visuals together.** You see data like funnels and user sessions along with session replays and heatmaps to understand what happened and why.
- **People view.** The People feature brings user data from React Native and Web into one simple profile.
- **Privacy first.** We don’t store personal info by default. You can turn tracking on or off, let users opt out, and blur replays when needed.
- **Works across platforms.** Built for Expo and React Native, and also works on Web.
