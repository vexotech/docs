# How Vexo Analytics Works

Understanding the technical architecture behind Vexo Analytics in React Native applications.

## Architecture Overview

Vexo Analytics operates as a lightweight, background service that automatically captures user interactions and app events without impacting your app's performance.

## Event Collection

### Automatic Events
Vexo automatically tracks:
- **App State Changes**: Foreground/background transitions
- **Screen Navigation**: Route changes and screen views
- **User Interactions**: Taps, swipes, and gestures
- **Device Events**: Orientation changes, network status
- **Performance Metrics**: App launch time, memory usage

### Custom Events
You can also track business-specific events:

```js
import { customEvent } from 'vexo-analytics';

// Track user actions
customEvent('button_clicked', {
  button_name: 'purchase',
  screen: 'product_detail'
});

// Track business metrics
customEvent('purchase_completed', {
  product_id: 'abc123',
  amount: 29.99,
  currency: 'USD'
});
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Event Capture**: Events are captured in real-time
2. **Local Buffering**: Data is temporarily stored locally
3. **Batch Upload**: Events are sent in optimized batches
4. **Real-time Processing**: Data appears in dashboard within minutes

## Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
- No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) collected
- All data encrypted in transit
- Optional user identification with your own identifiers

### User Consent
```js
import { enableTracking, disableTracking } from 'vexo-analytics';

// Respect user privacy preferences
const handlePrivacyToggle = async (userConsent) => {
  if (userConsent) {
    await enableTracking();
  } else {
    await disableTracking();
  }
};
```

## Performance Impact

- **Bundle Size**: < 50KB added to your app
- **Memory Usage**: < 5MB additional RAM
- **Battery Impact**: Negligible battery consumption
- **Network Usage**: Minimal, optimized batch uploads

## Integration with React Native

### Navigation Tracking
Works seamlessly with popular navigation libraries:
- React Navigation
- React Native Navigation
- Native Stack Navigator

### State Management
Compatible with all state management solutions:
- Redux
- MobX
- Zustand
- Context API
