# Introduction to Vexo

Vexo is the first React Native out of the box tool for analytics.
We provide a solution for precise and actionable data with a seamless integration and zero-configuration, zero-coding support.

Our documentation is a great place to find most answers and make sure that your experience using Vexo is a magical one.

## Quickstart

**Prerequisites**

- Using [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) or [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/)

**Expo**

- ✅ You can use this library with [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/development/introduction/). No config plugin is required.
- ❌ This library can't be used in the "Expo Go" app because it [requires custom native code](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/).

**Getting started**

1. Create an account [here](https://www.vexo.co/sign-up)
2. You'll be prompted into creating a new app, give it a cool name (you will be able to change that later) and once you submit it, you'll be given an API key.
3. Run `yarn add vexo-analytics` or `npm install vexo-analytics` in your project. If you are using bare React Native, run `pod install` in the iOS folder.
4. Add the following code to your app entry file (usually `index.js`, `App.js` or `_layout.tsx` if you're using Expo Router):

```js
import { vexo } from 'vexo-analytics';

// You may want to wrap this with `if (!__DEV__) { ... }` to only run Vexo in production.
vexo('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

5. Re-build and run your app (the `vexo-analytics` package includes native code).
6. Go to your app's page on Vexo and you should see your first event!

**Wait, that's it?** Yes! That's it. With that ease of integration experience you get an incredible set of features, go [check them out](https://docs.vexo.co/features)!
