## People

The **People** feature brings together every detail about your users in one place. Whether you’re analyzing a **React Native app** or also using **Vexo Web**, People gives you a complete and unified view of your users — right out of the box.

You can:

- **Sort by** last active date, number of sessions, number of replays, or user ID.
- **Filter by** timeframe, app version, operating system, or country.
- **Export data** to CSV for deeper analysis or sharing with your team.

## User Details

When you click on a user, you’ll access a detailed profile page that connects everything that user has done:

- A timeline of **custom events** they’ve triggered.
- A list of their **sessions**, including event details.
- Links to **session replays** when recordings are available.

This allows you to connect what happened (event), when it happened (session), and how it looked (replay).
