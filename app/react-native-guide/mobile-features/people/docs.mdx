## People

The **People** feature brings together every detail about your users in one place. Whether you’re analyzing a **React Native app** or also using **Vexo Web**, People gives you a complete and unified view of your users — right out of the box.

You can:

- **Sort by** last active date, number of sessions, number of replays, or user ID.
- **Filter by** timeframe, app version, operating system, or country.
- **Export data** to CSV for deeper analysis or sharing with your team.

## User Details

When you click on a user, you’ll access a detailed profile page that connects everything that user has done:

- A timeline of **custom events** they’ve triggered.
- A list of their **sessions**, including event details.
- Links to **session replays** when recordings are available.

This allows you to connect what happened (event), when it happened (session), and how it looked (replay).

## Usage

As well as being seamless, privacy is a key focus. We don't store any PII from your devices or users, so we provide a way in which you can identify a user in order
to be able to navigate through your dashboards in a personalized way.
To achieve this, do the following:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { View } from 'react-native'
import { identifyDevice } from 'vexo-analytics'

const LoginComponent = () => {
    const login = async () => {
        // your code
        await identifyDevice('IDENTIFIER');
    }
    return (<View>{...}</View>);
};
```

It's important to note that the identifier is a string and can be anything you want. We recommend that you identify your device with a token/hash
that you can then map it into your users' data to be able to know which user is it.
As an example, in SQL a unique ID as a foreign key to your users' table should suffice.

In case you want to make the device anonymous, `identifyDevice` supports `null` like in the following example:

```js
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { View } from 'react-native'
import { identifyDevice } from 'vexo-analytics'

const TrackerComponent = () => {
    const onAskedNotToTrack = async () => {
        // your code
        await identifyDevice(null);
    }
    return (<View>{...}</View>);
};
```
