### How it works

Tracking custom events is a great way to gain insight into key business metrics. To make it easier
to track each custom events we allow our enterprise users to add custom widgets to their dashboard, this
custom widgets shows the daily events of a selected custom events filtered by any property attached to it.

Additionally, custom widgets support the same global filters as the rest of the dashboard so all the information
you'll see shares the same context.

### Usage

<Warning message={(<div>Follow <Link href="/custom-events">this link</Link> for a guide on how to integrate custom events.</div>)} />

You'll be prompt with a form asking you to name your widget and select any of your custom events. Optinally,
you can add any number of filters based on your custom event properties.

Once you completed filling in the form, hit submit and your widget will be automatically added to your dashboard.
We'll gather all the data necessary and show the daily custom event usage for any period of time selected, even periods
before the custom widget was ever added to your dashboard!
