# Users Devices

One of the key aspects of your React Native Analytics is understanding the distribution of operating systems among your users.
By gaining insights into whether your users predominantly use iOS or Android, you can make data-driven decisions to optimize your app for the most popular platform.

As an example, if you recognize that the majority of your users are iOS users, you might consider performance tests in that platform since the impact of any release is going to be higher.

We count a device system name (iOS, Android, Windows phone, etc.) without counting the differences between those models, so regardless the model and the operating system being used, it would add 1 towards this totals.
