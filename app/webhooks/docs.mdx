# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to be notified every time a custom event is triggered.

Here you are able to set an endpoint to which we'll send all custom events.

Once created, you'll see a validation token. This token will be included on every
request send to the endpoint on the header: X-Vexo-API-Token.

The request payload will be a list of custom events. Each with an id, name, timestamp 
and args. *args* will be an object containing all the custom properties attached to
the event.
