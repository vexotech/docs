# Total Sessions

### How it works

As mentioned in [average-session metric](https://vexo.co/docs/average-session),
A user's session begins with the initial event of starting to use the app and extends until the app is either closed or the screen is locked.

By tracking the total number of sessions across a given timeframe you will be able to understand how much your users interact with your app.
Combining this with the active users and session time stats you will get a clear picture of your app userbase.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="total-sessions"
    previous={{ href: 'unique-downloads', label: 'Unique Downloads'}}
    next={{ href: 'users-by-country', label: 'Users By Country' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
