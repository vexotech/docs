# Session Replays


As discussed in [device sessions](https://docs.vexo.co/sessions), Vexo provides powerful insights into user behavior,
helping you make critical business decisions. With Session Replays,
you can gain an even deeper understanding. Engaging users with your app is one of the
biggest challenges, and Session Replays will let you see what’s happening behind the
scenes firsthand.
You'll be able to view app activity enhanced by the data you’re already benefiting from.

We’re big on privacy, and we make sure you have control over what’s recorded in Session Replays.
You can blur the replay, adjust video duration, and [more](https://docs.vexo.co/app-tracking-information), so you’re always in the driver’s seat.
Plus, we’ve put extra care into making sure replays don’t slow things down—our testing
shows no big impact on CPU or memory use. Replay files are pretty lightweight,
averaging around 200 KB per minute, and if you’d like, you can set them to upload
only over WiFi to save on data.


This feature is great to understand specific behavior from a user,
track down bugs from your application, and understand that users are following patterns when using your app.
