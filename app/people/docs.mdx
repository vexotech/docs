# People

It's important to see who are the users that have access to the data behind your application, and what type of access they have.
You can change the level of access for each team member at any point in time, if you have the required permissions for it.
There are three defined levels of access:
* __Owner:__ Only one person per app can be the owner, it refers to the person who created the app and has all privileges.
* __Guest:__ They only have access to read the data from your application, no modifications allowed.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="people"
    previous={{ href: 'app-general-information', label: 'App General Information'}}
    next={{ href: 'delete-application', label: 'Delete Application' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
