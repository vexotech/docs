# App Intensity

### How it works

App intensity is calculated by counting the total amount of events that happen in your app and distributing them over the hours of the week.

Events will be grouped by the hour in which they occur (in UTC and then translated to your local timezone) and then crossed out with the days of the week,
so that we can aggregate the total events and calculate the percentage for each hour, showing at what day and time your app's activity is hotter.

The time in which your app is used the most used is important so that you can provide a customizable experience for your users,
for example, by sending notifications when you know for sure there's activity happening.

<DocImage src="/docs/app-intensity.png" width="502" height="260" smallImage/>

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="app-intensity"
    previous={{ href: 'version-adoption', label: 'Version Adoption'}}
    next={{ href: 'custom-events', label: 'Custom Events' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
