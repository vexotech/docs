# Publishing your app

### Introduction

Publishing your application to a store is an exciting step of the development journey. When submitting your application to
the store you'll be asked about privacy and data collection practicies. We'll guide you through the process
on each platform.

### Publishing to Apple store

Apple requires you to fill out the App Privacy form when you submit your app to the App Store.

When using Vexo Analytics there are some items that **must** be checked when submitting your app.

#### Do you or your third-party partners collect any data from this app?


Select **yes** when asked if a third-party partner is collecting any data. As listed above, with Vexo you are tracking 
a lot of information out of the box.

#### Usage Data

Next, you'll be asked the data types you collect.
Regarding Vexo the only data types you need to select is **Product Interaction** and **Usage Data**.

You’ll then be asked to expand on how you use the Product Interaction data. Select **Analytics** as the answer.

Then next question is related to **User Identification**.
We are not any personal information so you can safely select **No** for this question.

Finally, they’ll explain their definition of what Tracking is and ask you to confirm if you track users.
Apple only considers tracking when data is linked to an user’s identity and used for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, which is not something we do at Vexo so you can select *No*.

### Publishing to Google store

When submiting to the Google store you'll need to submit information about what your app tracks too. Particulary you'll need
to select specific options on **Data collection and security** and **Data safety**


#### Data collection and security

You'll be asked if your app collects or shares any of the required user data types and if that data is encrypted. You must select 
**yes** to both of them.

#### Data safety

Next you'll be asked about data safety. Make sure to select **Device or other IDs** since Vexo uses them.

And thats it! Once your app is approved you'll enjoy all the insights Vexo provides out of the box!
