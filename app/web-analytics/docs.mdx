# Getting Started with Vexo Web Analytics

Web analytics is now available on Vexo! You can start tracking user behavior on your website with the same powerful tools you already use for mobile — all in just a few steps.

1. **Create a Web App.**

Head to your Vexo dashboard and create a new app. Give your app a name (e.g., your website’s name)

2. **Add the domain of your website**

Go to your app settings and update the web domain (e.g., *example.com*)

3. **Add the Vexo Script**

To start collecting analytics data, paste the following script into your site’s `<head>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://www.vexo.co/analytics.js" defer></script>
```

4. **Track custom events and identify devices (optional)**

You can enhance your analytics by tracking custom events and identifying devices:

- Custom Event

```js
global?.vexo?.customEvent('purchased-completed', { amount: 24.99 });
```

- Identify device

```js
global?.vexo?.identifyDevice('user@example.com');
```

That’s it! Once the script is live on your site, Vexo will start capturing user sessions, session replays, custom events, and more — just like it does on mobile.
