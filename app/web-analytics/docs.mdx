# Getting Started with Vexo Web Analytics

Web analytics is now available on Vexo! You can start tracking user behavior on your website with the same powerful tools you already use for mobile — all in just a few steps.

1. **Create a Web App.**

Head to your Vexo dashboard and create a new app.

- Give your app a name (e.g., your website’s name)
- Add the domain of your website (e.g., *example.com*)

<DocImage src="/docs/web-analytics.png" width="1018" height="440"/>

2. **Add the Vexo Script**

To start collecting analytics data, paste the following script into your site’s `<head>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://www.vexo.co/analytics.js" defer></script>
```

That’s it! Once the script is live on your site, Vexo will start capturing user sessions, session replays, custom events, and more — just like it does on mobile.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="web-analytics"
    previous={{ href: 'publishing', label: 'Publishing'}}
    next={{ href: 'active-users', label: 'Active Users' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
