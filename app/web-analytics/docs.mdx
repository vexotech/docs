# Getting Started with Vexo Web Analytics (Beta)


Web analytics is now available on Vexo! While still in **beta**, you can start tracking user behavior on your website with the same powerful tools you already use for mobile — all in just a few steps.

1. **Join the Beta.**


To get early access to Vexo Web Analytics, email us at <a href="mailto:hello@vexo.co">hello@vexo.co</a>. We’ll help you get onboarded and activate web tracking for your account.


2. **Create a Web App.**


Once you’re in the beta, head to your Vexo dashboard and create a new app.

- Give your app a name (e.g., your website’s name)
- Add the domain of your website (e.g., *example.com*)

<DocImage src="/docs/web-analytics.png" width="1018" height="440"/>

3. **Add the Vexo Script**


To start collecting analytics data, paste the following script into your site’s `<head>` tag:

```html
<script src="https://www.vexo.co/analytics.js" defer></script>
```

That’s it! Once the script is live on your site, Vexo will start capturing user sessions, session replays, custom events, and more — just like it does on mobile.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="web-analytics"
    previous={{ href: 'publishing', label: 'Publishing'}}
    next={{ href: 'active-users', label: 'Active Users' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
