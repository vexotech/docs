# Most Popular Paths

### How it works

Most popular paths offer a visual representation of the frequently followed user journeys within your app.
Paths are presented as a sequence of screens, each accompanied by its respective name and screenshot.
Paths are then organized in descending order of popularity, reflecting the number of users who have completed each path.

A path is established withing a [session](https://vexo.co/docs/sessions), implying that a path will be recorded from the moment the user opens the app until its closure. 
Once the user reopens the app, a new path will be recorded. It's also important to note that only sequences comprising three or more screens will be regarded as valid paths. 

Additional insights can be obtained for each popular path.
You will have access to per-screen data, information on retained and lost users, top 10 network requests, custom events and errors.
Specifically, retained users refer to those who reached a particular screen, while lost users indicate those who transitioned to other screens.

This feature will help you to gain a deeper understanding of how users navigate through your app. 
By identifying high-engagement pathways and areas where users tend to drop off, you can fine-tune the app for improved user engagement and conversion rates.
