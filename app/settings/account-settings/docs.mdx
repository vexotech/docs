# Account information

Account information describes the high overview information of your profile. This is where your personal information is, and modifiable info as well, such as your e-mail, your profile and other data.

This is where you can change your name or the e-mail that you've provided.

# Subscription Information

You can review and adjust your plan details:

- **Subscription Interval:** Monthly or annual billing.
- **Seats:** Number of team members with access.
- **Events per Month:** Plan limit (e.g., 1M events for $39/mo).
- **Enable Overage:** When enabled, extra events that go over your plan are billed automatically without pausing tracking.

> Example: Extra events above your plan limit are charged at $0.076 per 1,000 events.
> 

To modify your plan, adjust the fields and click **Update Subscription**.

# Delete Account

Deleting your account is a feature we provide to assure every user that the data belongs to yourself.
By deleting your app, we will delete **all the information** that relates to your account.
This is a really sensible operation, and it is not recommended to take it lightly, this is because when deleting your account, we'll delete:
* All of the apps you own
* Related data from the apps you own
* Screenshots from the apps
* Empty all caches with your information
* Delete all API keys
* Block data from remnant clients that are still sending data to [Vexo](https://vexo.co)

This is done this way so that we assure privacy for your business and that your data is yours, only that it flows through our systems.
