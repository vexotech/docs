# General information

General information describes the high overview information of your profile.
This is where your personal information is, and modifiable info as well, such as your e-mail, your profile and other data.

This is where you can change your name or the e-mail that you've provided.

# Delete Account

Deleting your account is a feature we provide to assure every user that the data belongs to yourself.
By deleting your app, we will delete **all the information** that relates to your account.
This is a really sensible operation, and it is not recommended to take it lightly, this is because when deleting your account, we'll delete:
* All of the apps you own
* Related data from the apps you own
* Screenshots from the apps
* Empty all caches with your information
* Delete all API keys
* Block data from remnant clients that are still sending data to [Vexo](https://vexo.co)

This is done this way so that we assure privacy for your business and that your data is yours, only that it flows through our systems.
