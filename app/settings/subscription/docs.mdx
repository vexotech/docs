# Subscription

Vexo offers simple, transparent plans designed to grow with your app — from early-stage projects to high-traffic products. You can switch plans or adjust event limits anytime right from your account.

### How Vexo Plans Work

All Vexo plans are based on your **total monthly events** across apps and websites in your account. An event includes both direct and indirect interactions with your app or site — such as taps, clicks, navigations, API calls, errors, and custom events.

You can check your real-time usage anytime in **Account Settings → Subscription**.

### Vexo Plan Tiers

**Free** – For small apps or during development. Perfect to try Vexo out.

Includes up to **100k events**, **100 session replays**, **2,000 heatmaps**, and **2 free seats**.

**Premium - $16/mo annual billing ($19/mo monthly billing)**

Best for teams launching their next project.

Includes up to **250k events**, **1,000 session replays**, **unlimited heatmaps**, and **2 seats** with full access to all features.

**Enterprise – $32/mo annual billing ($39/mo monthly billing)**

Ideal for apps with a growing or large user base.

Includes up to **1M events**, **4,000 session replays**, **unlimited heatmaps**, **2 seats**, and a **customizable dashboard**.

Within the Enterprise plan, you can scale beyond 1M events — pricing adjusts with usage, and you can set your event cap directly in your account.

### Going Over Your Monthly Event Limit

You’ll never be billed unexpectedly. If **Overages** are enabled, additional events beyond your plan are billed at the specified rate. Otherwise, Vexo stops tracking new events once you reach **120% of your plan limit**, while keeping all your existing stats accessible.

If higher traffic becomes consistent, you can upgrade seamlessly to the next tier or adjust your Enterprise event cap. Upgrades are **self-serve and prorated**, so you only pay for the remaining period.

### Managing Your Subscription

You can update your plan, switch billing frequency, or cancel anytime in **Account Settings → Subscription**.

There are no contracts, hidden fees, or penalties — just flexible plans designed for growth.
