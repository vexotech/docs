# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to be notified every time a custom event is triggered. **Note: Webhooks are ONLY triggered for custom events, not for standard tracking events.**

Here you are able to set an endpoint to which we'll send all custom events.

Once created, you'll see a validation token. This token will be included on every
request sent to the endpoint as a Bearer token in the header: `X-Vexo-API-Token: Bearer <your-token>`.

## Request Format

The request payload will be a JSON array of custom events with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "string",
    "name": "string", 
    "args": {
      // Custom properties object
    },
    "timestamp": number
  }
]
```

### Field Details

- **id**: Unique identifier for the event (UUID as string)
- **name**: The custom event name as specified when tracking the event
- **args**: Object containing all custom properties attached to the event (internal Vexo fields are filtered out)
- **timestamp**: Unix timestamp when the event occurred
