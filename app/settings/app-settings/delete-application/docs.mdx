# Delete Application

Deleting your app is a feature we provide to assure every user that the data belongs to yourself.
By deleting your app, we will delete **all the information** from your app as well as the images, caches and everything that's related to it.
Once this operation is requested, there is no turning back as we start the delete process effective immediately and there is no cancelling, so please be sure before you act upon deleting the data.
