# People

The **People** feature brings together every detail about your website visitors in one place. Whether you’re analyzing your **Web traffic** alone or together with **React Native**, People provides a complete and unified view of your users — automatically, out of the box.

You can:

- **Sort by** last active date, number of sessions, number of replays, or user ID.
- **Filter by** timeframe, browser, operating system, or country.
- **Export data** to CSV for deeper analysis or sharing with your team.

## User Details

When you click on a user, you’ll open a detailed profile view that connects everything that visitor has done:

- A timeline of **custom events** they’ve triggered.
- A list of their **sessions**, including all recorded events.
- Links to **session replays** when available.

This lets you connect what happened (event), when it happened (session), and how it looked (replay).

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout current="web-people">{children}</DocLayout>
