# Session Replays

**Session Replays** give you a visual understanding of how users interact with your website. You can watch real browsing sessions to see clicks, scrolls, navigation paths, and other user behaviors in context.

Replays are especially useful for understanding user experience issues, tracking down bugs, or validating product changes. Combined with analytics data, they give you the full picture of *what happened* and *why*.

Vexo prioritizes privacy and performance. You have full control over what is recorded — with options to blur sensitive content, limit video length, or restrict uploads to Wi‑Fi only. Replay files are optimized for efficiency, averaging around 200 KB per minute, and have minimal impact on site performance.

This feature is ideal for observing specific user behavior, debugging issues, and validating design or content decisions based on real user interaction.
