# OS Distribution

Understanding which operating systems your visitors use — such as Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, or Linux — helps you make informed optimization decisions. By identifying which platforms dominate your audience, you can focus testing and performance improvements where they’ll have the biggest impact.

For example, if the majority of your traffic comes from macOS, you might prioritize Safari performance testing. Each OS is counted once per user, providing a clear breakdown of your audience’s technology landscape.
