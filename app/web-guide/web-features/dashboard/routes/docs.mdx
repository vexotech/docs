# Routes

Routes visualize how users move through your website. You can see which pages attract the most traffic, where people enter, and which paths lead to drop‑offs or conversions.

Each route reflects real navigation behavior captured from page views during sessions. By analyzing the most common paths, you can better understand user flow and improve content structure or internal linking.

Pair Routes with Funnels and Custom Events to uncover how visitors progress through key journeys — like landing on a blog post, exploring pricing, and eventually signing up or purchasing.
