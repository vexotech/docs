# UTMs

UTM tracking allows you to measure and compare the performance of your campaigns across different platforms. Vexo automatically captures these parameters:

- **utm_source** — identifies where the traffic originated (e.g. `bing`, `newsletter`, `producthunt`)
- **utm_medium** — shows the channel type (e.g. `paid`, `social`, `email`)
- **utm_campaign** — tracks the specific campaign (e.g. `summer_launch`)
- **utm_content** — distinguishes between ad versions or placements
- **utm_term** — includes keywords or targeting terms from paid search

You can filter your reports by any of these attributes to analyze campaign reach and impact. For example, you can see how many signups or sessions came from a particular email series, banner, or sponsored post.

Vexo also recognizes paid ad identifiers such as `gclid` and `msclkid` from Google Ads and Microsoft Ads. These are automatically anonymized to stay GDPR‑compliant while maintaining accurate attribution.

UTM data works seamlessly with **Geographic Insights**, letting you see where your campaigns perform best and refine your targeting for future promotions.
