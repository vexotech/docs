# Referrers

Referrers show the external websites, platforms, or apps that send visitors to your site. They help you understand where your traffic originates — whether that’s from search engines, social networks, blogs, or partner domains — so you can identify which sources drive the most valuable audiences.

Vexo automatically attributes new sessions to the correct referral source and avoids counting redirects like payment gateways or authentication services. This means that if a user briefly leaves your site to complete a payment and then returns, the original source (for example, a newsletter or social post) is still credited for the visit.

To keep reports clean, Vexo consolidates similar or variant sources. For example, traffic from links tagged as `instagram`, `ig`, or `instagram-ads` will be grouped under a single Instagram entry.

If a visitor lands on your site from `technews.io/article/launch-review`, Vexo records the referrer as `technews.io`. This simple, privacy‑friendly approach keeps your analytics easy to interpret while still highly actionable.

Referrer data helps you evaluate partnerships, outreach efforts, and the performance of organic mentions or backlinks.
