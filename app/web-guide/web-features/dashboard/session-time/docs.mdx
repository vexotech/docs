# Session Time

A session begins when a visitor opens your website and ends when they close the tab or remain inactive for a certain period.

The average session time is calculated as:

*average session time = total session duration / total sessions*

Longer session times may indicate that visitors are exploring content, while shorter ones could suggest quick interactions or clear navigation. Use this data to evaluate engagement and optimize the flow of your pages.
