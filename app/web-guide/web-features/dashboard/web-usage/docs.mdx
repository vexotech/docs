# Web Usage

Web Usage is calculated by counting the total number of events that occur on your website — such as page views, clicks, and scrolls — and distributing them across the hours and days of the week.

Events are grouped by the hour they happen (in UTC and then adjusted to your local timezone) and mapped against the days of the week. This creates a heatmap that highlights when your website activity peaks.

Knowing when your site is most active helps you make smarter decisions — like scheduling announcements, releases, or marketing campaigns when engagement is at its highest.
