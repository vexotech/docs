# Customize your dashboard

### How it works

Tracking custom events is one of the most powerful ways to gain insight into your product and user behavior. To make this easier, Vexo allows Premium and Enterprise users to **add custom widgets** directly to their dashboard. Each widget displays the daily usage of a selected custom event, filtered by any properties you’ve defined.

Custom widgets support the same **global filters** as the rest of your dashboard, so every metric you see remains consistent and in context. You can easily compare your custom metrics alongside your main analytics data.

### Usage

To start tracking a custom event on your dashboard:

1. Click the **Add to Dashboard** button.
2. Enter a name for your widget.
3. Select one of your existing custom events.
4. (Optional) Add one or more filters based on the event’s properties — for example, filtering by plan type, country, or device.
5. Click **Submit** to save.

Once created, your widget will automatically populate with data, showing the daily usage of that event for any selected period — including historical data that occurred before the widget was added.

You can find full integration steps in the Custom Events guide.
