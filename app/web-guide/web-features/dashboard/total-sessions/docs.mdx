# Total Sessions

The total number of sessions represents how many browsing sessions were initiated on your site within a given period. Each session begins when a visitor lands on your site and ends after inactivity or closure.

This metric helps you understand overall activity and returning traffic when analyzed together with **Active Users** and **Session Time**.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout current="web-total-sessions">{children}</DocLayout>
