# Browser Distribution

See which browsers your visitors use most often — Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and others — to ensure a smooth and consistent experience for everyone. Knowing your audience’s browser preferences helps you detect compatibility issues early, optimize rendering performance, and test new features on the browsers that matter most.

If you notice that a large share of your users visit from Safari, for instance, focusing on WebKit-specific improvements can make a measurable difference in user experience.
