# Active Users

This metric helps you measure the level of engagement on your website. A user is considered active when they interact with your site **at least once,** whether that’s a page view, click, or any tracked event, within the selected timeframe.

The total count increases when a new or returning visitor interacts with your site for the first time during the selected period. A visitor who returns on multiple days will count as active for each of those days, though the total unique number will remain the same.

This metric gives you a clear view of your audience’s consistency and engagement trends over time.
