# Custom Events

### How it works

Custom Events allow you to track specific actions that matter most to your business — beyond standard website behavior like page views or clicks. These can be anything from a product purchase to a form submission or a feature interaction.

When a custom event is triggered, Vexo automatically contextualizes it with relevant data, such as the visitor’s device, browser, session, and version. This gives you a complete understanding of not only what happened, but under which conditions it occurred.

For example, if you track a `purchase-completed` event, Vexo might reveal that 60% of those events come from Chrome users and that your latest site version increased conversions by 10%. This context helps you make informed product and marketing decisions.

In your dashboard, custom events display two types of counts:

- **Total count:** the total number of times an event occurred.
- **Unique count:** how many individual users triggered the event (no matter how many times each one did).

### Usage

To add a custom event on your website, use the following snippet:

```jsx
global?.vexo?.customEvent('purchased-completed', { amount: 24.99 });

```

You can attach any additional parameters that are relevant to your product or business.

If you want to associate a user with a specific session or device, you can optionally identify them:

```jsx
global?.vexo?.identifyDevice('user@example.com');
```
