# Web Introduction

Vexo Web Analytics brings the same out-of-the-box analytics experience from React Native. 

Providing a solution for precise and actionable data, add a single script and start seeing real usage data in your dashboards immediately with zero-configuration, zero-coding support.

Vexo’s web script runs on static sites and modern frameworks alike. If you can add a `<script>` tag to your `<head>`, you can use Vexo.

**Tested Platforms:** Vexo Web has been tested and works with a variety of setups, including **Next.js**, **React** (CRA, Vite, etc.), **React Native Web**, **Vue.js**, **Angular**, **Svelte**, **Astro**, **Gatsby**, as well as plain static HTML/JS sites. (No React Native mobile app is required to use Vexo Web – it works completely standalone on any website.)

👉 **Note**: You don’t need a React Native app to use Vexo Web. It works completely standalone on any website.

**When to use Vexo Web**

- You want quick visibility into traffic and behavior with minimal setup
- You already use Vexo for mobile and want a unified view across platforms
- You need replays and funnels without maintaining complex client code

> Status: Web is actively evolving. Core analytics, replays, and custom events are production-ready. If you need advanced attributes (e.g., city-level location or detailed device breakdowns), reach out—we’re expanding coverage.
