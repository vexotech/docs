# Device Sessions

### How it works

As mentioned in [average-session metric](https://vexo.co/docs/average-session),
A user's session begins with the initial event of starting to use the app and extends until the app is either closed or the screen is locked.

Contained under a session, we will track user actions and show them ordered by the time those events happened so that you can understand the sequence
under analysis. Sessions will be listed by device with valuable data added to further understand what is it that you are taking a look at,
such as the time a session took, the amount of events, the app version, the device model and more!

This feature is great to understand specific behavior from a user,
track down bugs from your application, and understand that users are following patterns when using your app.
