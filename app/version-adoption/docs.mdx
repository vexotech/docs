# Version Adoption

### How it works

Version adoption let's you know which devices are up to date with your latest changes and which was your most popular release.

Every time we receive events from the devices using Vexo, we check the version that's being currently used and map the device to the version under usage.
We verify the latest version your users are on, and compare the adoption between all of them by calculating its percentage over the total devices.
This is an aggregation panel where multiple users that have gone through multiple versions, are included.

You have 200+ users in your app and 83 of them are using version `v1.7` which is as well the latest.
It happens that you discover a small bug, and release a new version, let's call it `v1.8`.
Then, 103 users download the new version and start using it, and a new user also registers,
so we'll update those devices into the new version.
