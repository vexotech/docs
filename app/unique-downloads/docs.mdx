# Unique Downloads

### How it works


Gaining insights into how often your app is downloaded is a key factor in making informed marketing decisions.

We ensure each download is counted uniquely when the app is initially installed on a device. If a user downloads the app multiple times on the same device, we'll still treat it as a single download.

Our download tracking mechanism triggers upon the user's initial app launch. This methodology provides the most accurate approximation of download times, aligning with typical user behaviorâ€”downloading and promptly launching the app. This precision is measured within seconds.

export default ({ children }) => <DocLayout
    current="unique-downloads"
    previous={{ href: 'average-session', label: 'Average Session'}}
    next={{ href: 'drop-off-rate', label: 'Drop Off Rate' }} >
        {children}
</DocLayout>
