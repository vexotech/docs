# Funnels

<Warning message={(<div>This feature is for <b>premium & enterprise</b> accounts only</div>)} />

Funnels help you track how users move through a sequence of actions in your app.
You can use them to see where users drop off and where they continue,
helping you optimize key flows like onboarding, purchases, or feature adoption.

<DocImage src="/docs/funnels-first-step.png" width="1018" height="392" />


To set up a funnel, you add steps based on custom events (like "Clicked Sign Up" or "Completed Purchase") or
screen navigation events (like "Viewed Checkout Screen" or "Viewed Settings Page").
A funnel must have at least 2 steps and can include up to 8 steps.

Once saved, Vexo will start tracking users who move through the steps so you can analyze where they drop off and where they convert.
